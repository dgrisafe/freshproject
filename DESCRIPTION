Description: Create folders for a new scientific data analysis project.
    I found myself manually recreating the same folders and subfolders.
    This package is my attempt at organizing my personal as an
    epidemiologist studying clinical data. But I think this 
    project organization will be useful for all scientific
    data analysis projects, regardless of discipline.
